I am Shangqin Hao (郝尚钦), a Ph.D. in Earth Sciences at the [Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego](https://igpp.ucsd.edu/). My research focuses on resolving fine-scale structures in the Earth's interior, primarily through the analysis of teleseismic body waves. By integrating seismic observations with insights from mineral physics and geodynamic modeling, I aim to advance our understanding of the Earth's temperature distribution, compositional variations, and evolutionary processes. I am also interested in resolving detailed shallow structures using dense seismic arrays and innovative methodologies, with the goal of addressing critical environmental and societal challenges.
